## Condensed Bio
+Personal experience programming and modifying computers and electronics since middle school
+Educated as Electrical Engineer with focus on Robotics and Embedded Systems and a Business Administration minor
+Work experience as Digital Systems Engineer, Embedded Systems Engineer, and most recently as a Business Analyst, which made me realize I need to work in a field I feel passionate about, software development

## Branding Statement
A tinkerer since birth, programmer and computer nerd since high school, and now a university educated Electrical Engineer. With experience in Embedded Systems Development, Test Automation, and Business Analytics. I now know I have to work in a field that I am passionate with and wish to transition into a career in software development, preferably with a focus on mobile and/or embedded platforms. Both that I have personal and professional experience with.

## Condensed Bio
+Personal experience programming and modifying computers and electronics since middle school
+Educated as Electrical Engineer with focus on Robotics and Embedded Systems and a Business Administration minor
+Work experience as Digital Systems Engineer, Embedded Systems Engineer, and most recently as a Business Analyst, which made me realize I need to work in a field I feel passionate about, software development

## Branding Statement
1. A tinkerer since birth, programmer and computer nerd since high school, and now a university educated Electrical Engineer. With experience in Embedded Systems Development, Test Automation, and Business Analytics. I now know I have to work in a field that I am passionate with and wish to transition into a career in software development, preferably with a focus on mobile and/or embedded platforms. Both that I have personal and professional experience with.

2. Passionate Electrical and Software Engineer with personal, professional, and academic experience in Embedded Systems & iOS Development. Approaches software development with a full understanding of computing systems from high level design architectures to how those designs direct transistors on the atomic level. After a successful trial run in financial analysis it became clear through using programming to augment my analysis that software development is best fit for a rewarding career.

## Experience
Applied Value (Management Consulting)
*New York, NY*
*Sep. 2014 - Jun. 2015*
Analyst
+ Wrote Python programs and Visual Basic scripts to automate scraping of finance data for client analysis, reducing the time spent performing financial analysis
+ Performed analysis on said financial data to help create plans to improve client company's operational efficiency that contributed to new consulting contracts earned by the sales team.
+ Created VBA scripts and interfaces to update email and phone lists for of clients and potential clients, to drastically reduce sales team's time spent on managing client lists.
+ Performed deep-dive research on companies to determine if they are good investments or clients, and if so what industry competencies they have. My background in technology fields meant I could perform thorough industry research.

ABB (Industrial Automation)
*Västerås, Sweden*
*Sep. 2012 - Mar. 2013*
Embedded Software Developer
+ Wrote scripts in bash on automation servers to test hardware and robotic environment. Adding old test functionality to their new operating system.
+ Added and tested interrupt routines in C++ and their own proprietary "RAPID" language, to improve safety of pick-place robots on new family of controllers that halt the system if there are any safety conditions not met.
+ Helped develop event-driven libraries in C++ that ported functionality of old control operating system to a new one that was being released.

Sony Ericsson (Now Sony Mobile)
*Lund, Sweden*
*May 2011 - Aug. 2011*
Electronics Engineering Intern
+ Tested and debugged manufacturing samples of different mobile circuit boards to help team find areas where either the design of the boards could improve or the manufacturing process, which ended in two design revisions.
+ Designed and created a regulator testing device that could log voltage regulator transient response under different load conditions, improving the team's ability to quickly diagnose power conditioning problems of engineering sample boards.

Redback (Acquired by Ericsson)
*San Jose, CA*
*Jun. 2010 - Aug. 2010*
Electronics Engineering Intern
+ Helped design and test logic shifters, regulators and fan controllers for their network products.

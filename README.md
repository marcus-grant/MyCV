# MyCV


My Personal CV directory, which I use to update the textual information of each part of a resume, including it's cover letter when I need it, and then use various scripts and tools to compile it using LaTeX to come up with a tailor made resume for my current needs. Feel free to use any part of this, except of course trying to pass my CV off as your own, that would just be dumb anyways.

\begin{cvparagraph}

Passionate Electrical and Software Engineer with personal, professional, and academic experience in Embedded Systems \& iOS Development, and years of tinkering with computers and electronics. Approaches software development with a full understanding of computing systems from high level design architectures to how those designs direct transistors on the atomic level. After a successful trial run in financial analysis it became clear through using programming to augment my analysis that software development is the best fit for a rewarding career.
